My role involved setting up the RESTful API that handles book-related operations, user authentication, and review management. I used Node.js and Express.js for server-side development, along with MongoDB as the database using Mongoose as the ODM. I also implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure data security. The backend provides robust features such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for books, user management, and review validation. I worked collaboratively with a frontend developer to seamlessly integrate the frontend with the backend. The project followed best practices in data security, unique email validation, and the implementation of middlewares for request handling.",
